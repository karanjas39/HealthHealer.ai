      <h2>Your Dosha</h2>
      <p>
        Dosha is a fundamental concept in Ayurveda, which refers to the three
        basic energies or functional principles that govern the human body and
        mind. The three doshas are Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, and they are
        responsible for the physiological and psychological characteristics of
        each individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vata is the dosha of movement and governs all movement in the body, such
        as breathing, circulation, and nerve impulses. It is associated with
        creativity, vitality, and flexibility when in balance, but can lead to
        anxiety, dryness, and insomnia when out of balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pitta is the dosha of metabolism and transformation, and it controls
        digestion, metabolism, and body temperature. It is associated with
        intelligence, courage, and determination when in balance, but can lead
        to anger, inflammation, and ulcers when out of balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kapha is the dosha of structure and lubrication, and it governs the
        body's tissues and fluids, such as mucus, saliva, and synovial fluid. It
        is associated with stability, endurance, and compassion when in balance,
        but can lead to lethargy, weight gain, and depression when out of
        balance.

      <h2>Ayurvedic Solutions for Personalized Health and Well-being</h2>
      <p>
        Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest medical systems, dating back over
        5,000 years. It originated in the Indian subcontinent and is still
        widely practiced in India and other parts of the world. The word
        "Ayurveda" comes from the Sanskrit language and means "knowledge of
        life" or "science of life". The origins of Ayurveda can be traced back
        to ancient India, where it was practiced as a system of medicine and
        healthcare by the Vedic priests. The Vedas, a collection of ancient
        Indian texts, contain detailed descriptions of the principles and
        practices of Ayurveda. Ayurveda was developed based on the belief that
        health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body,
        and spirit. The system focuses on using natural remedies and techniques
        to restore balance and promote overall health and wellness. Over time,
        Ayurveda has evolved and expanded to include a wide range of practices,
        including herbal medicine, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation.
